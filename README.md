# HTML5 Practical Project - And the Mountains Echoed

This repository contains a personal website dedicated to my favorite book, *And the Mountains Echoed* by Khaled Hosseini. The site leverages semantic HTML5 for accessibility and structure, exploring the novel's themes of family, love, sacrifice, and generational connections.

## Pages

- **Home (index.html)**: Welcomes visitors with an introduction to *And the Mountains Echoed*, explaining why semantic HTML matters (clear structure, better discovery, accessible design, reader-friendly flow, and meaningful extras). Includes reasons for choosing the book and fun facts about its publication and author.
- **About (about.html)**: Details the history of *And the Mountains Echoed* (published in 2013, following Hosseiniâ€™s earlier works), its interconnected storytelling across generations and locations, and main themes (family bonds, love and sacrifice, separation, impact of decisions). Features a glossary of key terms and characters (e.g., Abdullah, Pari) using `<dl>`, plus reasons to recommend the book in an ordered list.
- **Media (media.html)**: Showcases a responsive book cover image using `<picture>` with `mountains-echoed-small.jpg`, `mountains-echoed-medium.jpg`, and `mountains-echoed-large.jpg`, an audio interview (`khaled-interview.mp3`) with `<audio>`, and a video trailer (`and-the-mountains-echoed-video.mp4`) with captions (`sample.vtt`) using `<video>`.
- **Extras (extras.html)**: Provides interactive elements including a `<table>` for a weekly reading schedule, `<details open>` for book insights on themes, `<dialog open>` with a quote, and `<progress>` and `<meter>` to track reading progress and emotional intensity.
